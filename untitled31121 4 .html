<I>Planning is always so spectacular..</I>

Other Notes:<UL>

<li>Other: @epad's @jota REPLACEMENTS<OL>
<li>//~ @quickedit has autosave, light/dark themes, auto syntax selector and the best: visual color picker (hex).
<pre> Saves regardless of switched window.
Line indicator as well as navigator. (If a bit bright).
Dark theme is more a grey than black.
Blue highlights are pretty though.
ed: Biggie #plux: No "Open with [other application]".
ll: fn+arrow does not acivate keyboard "home/end" as it should. #bah.
</pre>
<li>//~ @awd has bracket match highlighting, no autosave(?), autoclose brackets, cannot, what, ctrl+s<pre>Does this wierd "need to back to escape" thing whenever certain words are inputted.
Beautiful black colors and courier font in edit view.
Autocompletes tags, toggle autoclose tags and brackets.
Flash flash flash..
Has its own browser. (Have not tested #JS yet)
Now it's looking hella familiar..
Manual saving by click, click? No thank you.
ll: No way to tab naviate into that save function either. #bah. 
ll: Color picker on prefixing with hash. Nice autocomplete features (save that annoying escape thingy), cool autoclose/complete. Boo to almost everything else.
</pre>
<li> ll: So everything else is the pits. However @jota's annoying schtick with not recognising apostrophe-marks when they're by themselves and stapling them into syntax highlights is getting annoying. (When once upon a time it was part of the charm of a screen of not just simply white).
<li> ll: Definitely a #plux need for a more dedicated color selector. Cannot just keep relying on RGBa for the magic. (It's viable but since one is now familiar with it, theres not so much learning value left as there is tedium..).


</OL>


<li> @epad  "Open with" no longer has an option for browser. <OL>
edd: Uninstalled a while ago because thought it was extra..
<li> edd: [Open with Browser]; own icon on all applications screen, single option for default select. (optional?).
<li> [Better Open With]; Nothing in @jota's dialog. Restart? ll: Yeah nothing.
<li> 1st option just looks like it's best for keeps, yo.
</OL>

<li>@turbo, prettiness abounds. 
<PRE> A bit annoying with backspace and.. Random caps locking?
What in the heck is that seriously..
It's a huge bane to writing this shiz.
Another ed: point was that once before on hitting [ctrl+S], ad came up. This capitals toggling to random "insert" mode toggling is also annoying the hell out of this heebus. #bah.
</PRE>
