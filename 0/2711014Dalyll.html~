<b>Notes and Debuggery</b><ol>
<li>#forgot it is <i>script type=</i>, not simply "script=". //.
<li> canvas is not rendering css for <i>border: double 24px lightblue</i>.. After some thought, neither is background-color for the body. Something in the #css has been muddled.. //. <i>style type="text/css"</i> was #mistyped as "txt". 
<li>Wasn't importing external #js. #forgot to include in paste (or cutting of text) the <i>var ctx=...; c=..</i> lines. //.
<li>Change canvas #js: x co-ordinates of <i>strokeText</i> to conform to  end of text rather than start? [Unless otherwise specified, the textAlign property is defaulted to start.](Unless otherwise specified, the textAlign property is defaulted to start.). Nice. #later//
<li> ed: <i>closePath();</i> #doesntWork to "close in" formatting for one shape or another.
<li> keep #forget ting that <i>ctx.font</i> is a (compulsory) unit-size (pt, px, etc) first.
<li>#forgot animated #js: simple movement is simply <i> x+; y+ </i> combined with <i>setIncrement</i>. The <i>if</i> functions come in only with bounce.
<li> Increment variables apparently do not work with <i>var</i> prepended to line.. an edd: #later.
<li> #bug? Same values and still referred outside of drawing function but, for whatever reason, #doesnWork from indirectDraw+
