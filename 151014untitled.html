Life may be hard but even when you're all but pretending, there's a someone called you in this world. People can only sigh at the trivalities of love, life and honour.  If there's no place that you feel like you can go, calm, be still, be weak and walk back in the direction of friends. They'll be your first destination/compass on this road. 


Trace your steps. What did you like about the you who was with them, without them? Find yourself in those trivalities and finally, embrace life, live life. People are naturally vain and no-one can completely hate oneself. Somewhere out there, there's a moment of uncontained giggles from remembering a moment with you. Somewhere out there, someone can go gay for you if they knew you a bit better. Somewhere out there, there's a heart feeling blank without a something called you. Have faith, you were not born on this world for a lesser person's hate or annoyance. Because there's you, you and all your unique. There's a matching circle out there in everyone else, points for you and everybody else to connect to. We're made of the stuff of stars and a bit of each other. We are all meant to be classmates, comrades, teammates in the large obstacle course of life. Influence and be influenced. Learn and be learned.
