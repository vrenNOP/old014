one day a taniwhawent swimming in moana 
he whispered softly in my tainga
oh won't you come with me 
there's such a lot to see underneth the deep blue sea
isay oh no no, i've got to gog go
but will you still be firends with me
my mother i waitng for me 
underneath the kowhai tree
oh taniwha haere e ratblue;}
haere e ra

mythical beasts coming from  nowhere 
entice a slow comeone, over here, there's a mirro world where you can't see
and wonders of long you couldn't have ever fathomed
come over here and bask, i'll be you guide, just take my hand
you won't regret you won't demand
there's a world out there that you'll actually, i gaurantee, 
you'll want to see

maybe there's a danger, but that's not why i said no
the next day, i'll go searching for the missed opportunity
a waste from being scared of upsetting the higher authoity
to find a paradise land waiting
but no guide
but they'll be back while i'm waiting and some day seen
near and again, maybe a few years
the guide'll come whisprering again
a breeze the call
