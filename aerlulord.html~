<b>once upon a time there was this kid..</b>
he lived in a box and he had a hole in his shoe.
his pants were too big and a mile was too long.
he made cupcakes everyday but had to give bread away
the speed at which he ran into things was tax
and the rate of laughter returned from each dare
tasked, was the reward.
the amount of folly he watched in the time taken
to unwrap a present and become believed in, the
time taken to crack nuts and roll a blade over
"come on over here!" cried another boy one night
"I'll come, I'll come." he redplied rather grumpily.
"there's sites to see and minxes to catch" whispered a voice.
"glimpse here." it said.
there was a pale door sprung up suddenly in front of him
pale and almost translucent in its white coat of paint.
with a touch, it swung open.

before was a forest and person; an old man
back crooked down to half his spine
stood there and gave him a smile
"hello, how are you this pleasant evening, John?"
the boy looked up and it was indeed evening now
just as sure his name is,
the whispers had stolen the day away.
"good evening sir." he said politely giving a nod back  behind him
"i needed to lose something and came in here to get a breath of fresh air."
"oh and catch a glimpse of something." he added.
"this is a road to nowhere isn't it?"

the old man gave him an old look.
"why would you be on a raod to nowhere? why would you be taking it?"
"man cannot question never needing a breathe of fresh air, or indeed,
to find a glimpse of something."
"but man does not embark onto roads of unknown without a single think.
oh danger, oh hie, oh mercy be if freedom lies."
"john."

"i don't need to be edited to go this way" the boy thought crossly. "i am curious, i guess." he said to the man, his elder. "i'd like to see what comes down this way and what's behind you."
he did so want to go down. a twinkling was coming from somewhere in that behind. a twinkling with an accompanying sound like bells hung on trees, a sound a storybook star might make. oddly too, a little further down the pebbled path starting to form to his right, was a grwing purple on the horizon's line. a special sunset if he could see.

 ..
the old man is suddenly angry. "forget about living in a dream!" he shouted raising both arms far above his head. "over my dead body!" his face turned a dark red until it mud in color and when next he stomped the ground in agitation, his foot did not leave it again. "this way?" he said pointing with both hands in a mocking gesture. "that way?" his limbs grew and rapidly sprouted sub branches, like a tree but sideways. soon he was nothing more than just that, his face and skin hollowing to become the ridges of fine but old wood and his branches spreading out far behind him. his roots, first exposed and a mess, entangled with others as they buried themselves into the forest. the speck of purple horizon had a new leafy frame and the clearing was no longer a clearing. "that way?" echoed his voice still.

for some reason, the boy was not suprised at the arguably grosteque transformation. his former companion, whatever he was, he was not any brand of usual. he didn't frankly, look like he could be. so just as the old man had told him to, he propped one shod foot on the big sideways trunk and slowly picked his way across. it was rather diffcult trying to climb a tree sideways as they were not logs and did not hog up all walking space, sunken halfway into the earth or an easy makeshift if uneven surface to clamber all over.
