one day a taniwhawent swimming in moana 
he whispered softly in my tainga
oh won't you come with me 
there's such a lot to see underneth the deep blue sea
isay oh no no, i've got to gog go
but will you still be firends with me
my mother i waitng for me 
underneath the kowhai tree
oh taniwha haere e ratblue;}
haere e ra

mythical beasts coming from  nowhere 
entice a slow comeone, over here, there's a mirro world where you can't see
and wonders of long you couldn't have ever fathomed
come over here and bask, i'll be you guide, just take my hand
you won't regret you won't demand
there's a world out there that you'll actually, i gaurantee, 
you'll want to see

maybe there's a danger, but that's not why i said no
the next day, i'll go searching for the missed opportunity
a waste from being scared of upsetting the higher authoity
to find a paradise land waiting
but no guide
but they'll be back while i'm waiting and some day seen
near and again, maybe a few years
the guide'll come whisprering again
a breeze the call

lol and good evening again. =)

0. what does "OP" mean? In thread terms, it usually means the "opening" or introductional post by the user who kicked it off. With characters, i have seen "OC" used more. Neither seems to apply too aptly here if it was a typo. I am quite ignorant sometimes sorry.

1. Superpowers are always a little hard to develop variety for despite its misleading genre. I intend to try something relatng to nature but all my addle minded "inspiration" can conjusre up for now is something alike to drying people up randomly and horrifically, something slightly cliche like teleportation(actually it might be quite fun afterall), also randomly. And then..dunno, more random: fingers and other flexy limbs that can handle even the tiniest of things without a microscope and other..tiny-tooling tool. =/..

2. Science Fiction
Aging is quite typical of time travel. Let's twist it a bit and make it more than appearance. Let's make them age from inside out the more they use the TT(TimeTravel) thing. Effectively that means their insides start to shrivel and misfunction before their skin does. This hurts them consciously and painfully and they are, as you say, aging the more they use the ability.
This is kind of up to the player with the character (or characters) who do the TT thing though.
Telekenetic--just searched it up. same as "psychokinesis" lol; moving or influencing matter without touching 'em. Meaning unless demons do mindcontrol over all humans including the non-contracted ones, there's no chance of a psychokinesis wielder being able to do nothing even idnapped and all tied up X)
(i dunno. they could pass their demon, the belovedness the/a sword? X))

3. Fantasy
In my ever biased mind, "sci-fi" has always only ever been a subset or child from the great mother of greatness and wondering minds that is fantasy =)
I am all for the "leveling" of our characters in a craftsmen ruled world. My ideal RPG game if there was one. Can i play a woodsman? He could have a backstory with a mixture of red riding hood's, seven little kids, uhm, snow white? Etc Etc =D
Haha, how long do those wings last? Are there any repercussion during or after having them as with the behated and the void matters?

3. Sub  classes? Oh this really is becoming a game now..Lesse if i can contribute any..
Living in Nature: water, fire, air, rock, earth,  
= carrier, kindler, fanner, miner, potter,
the carrier purifies, the kindler warms, the fanner guides,
the miner seeks, the potter molds,

Lives in Nature: insects, mammal, reptile, bird, molluscs,
=scavengers, nurturers, messengers, hoarders, secreters,
scavengers forage for others, 
nurturers nurse for others, messengers go for others
hoarders gather for others, secreters keep for others

possible Subclasses:
carrier/Water = purifies water in air, water and the living
-fallers = call out the rain
-extractors = dry out moisture
-lakers = makes water from their own bodies
kindler/Fire = warms flames in wood, coal and the living
-beamers = focus the rays of the sun
-extractors = drops the temperature
-sparklers = turns into fire itself
fanner/Wind =  guides tides in wind, clouds and the living
- raisers = conducts a tornado center
- trekkers = speeds into invisibility 
- stringers = slams winds using force of will (like a glorified and violent "fanner"?)(.....)
miners/Stone =  seeks minerals in stone, rock and the living
- detectors =  identifies location and make
- shielders = absorbs posions
- attractors = polarises output of metals
potters/Earth =  molds objects in earth, clay and the living
-  
- 
-
(okay no seriously, i'm all out of juice. Help. lol.)

Each of the above can choose to:
- stay and specialise in the "original" subclass. 
- Or be a priest of their respective fields, promoting and preaching their indiviual causes by traveling. they work for free and live off the family of disciples they'll train and teach per town(?). This is the only way to possess ability of all subclasses though obviously never to the limits of which the specialised ones can be. Priests are sworn to their class and thus do not possess abilities of another. They have no special other moves unique to their "(sub)class" and are not allowed to stay in one place more than three months.

Characters can choose to have any or all of the above. Along with two "profession classes" (see below). The later is unique in that they are rotateable, a bit like careers. Take up or drop any one, two or both anytime. Rules or the limited and compulsory circumstances in which each comes about is up to player imagination. The downside is that each time a "power class" is stacked, effects of powers are decreased by half. for example:

Character = Wind + Water:laker
The character has: taking half of their power for wind, and half of that(a quarter) for being a water subclass. The  next skill they have will be half of that quarter or 1/8. This means of course that replacing "wind", the very first skill would mean having to replace the water:laker first and all others after it first. 
To replace skills, characters meet and are disciple to a priest of the desired element.  They train with them for a minimum of two weeks. though if they are discipled through all three months of the priest's stay, they can usually instantly pick two subclasses as the "first skill". This first skill is the only instance of stackable trainings and subsequent trainings with other priests can only yield one subclass.

Profession Classes
scavengers: hunters, adventurers, foragers etc.
nuturers: nurses, babysitters, cooks, etc
messengers: scribes, deliverers, daters, etc.
hoarders: merchants, landowners, issuers etc.
secretors: bankers, fortunetellers, , etc

Maybe levels can be advanced the fibonancii(spel?) way? that's:
0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5,  etc
which becomes 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,07,08,09,etc and
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13, 21,etc.. 
where the top row is the level and the bottom is the number of acts needed to advance.

eg.
level 0 + 1acts of class =level1
level1+1acts =level2
Except maybe that's way too easy. "+10" instead of "+1" then? 
so at level2 to level3, 10acts are still needed whilst
at level3 to level4, 20acts are needed and
at level8 to get to lvl9, 210 acts are needed =D

Guh. Done. Dead.
TTYL.

PS. You seem to be the type of the person to plot alot before story commences. Do you go for extreme accuracy as well? I have tried to be (sorta) realistic as i thought you might appreciate the detail more but as it is, i'm just quoting back what i've heard or read any old where.  ahahaha... X)  



---------

PPS. Yes that cleared things up very nicely. Kind of a cute twist that. Not sure why i said cute. btw, fyi, i'm more than biased myself when it comes to fantasy =D
